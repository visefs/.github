# ViseFS

_Work in Progress – Coming Soon_

</div>

## 🔍 What is ViseFS?
ViseFS ("Vise") is an opinionated dynamic user‑space filesystem built on FUSE (with **UniFuse** below for portability). It lets you inject the SAME logical file or directory into multiple places, present synthetic structure, and treat generated / projected content as if it were native on disk. Edit it in any injected location—there is a single source of truth.

Think: a living virtual mount where code, build artifacts, versioned toolchains, and templated layouts appear exactly where each consumer expects—without copying or symlinks sprawl.

Illustrative (early) scenarios (media / cloud backends intentionally deferred):
- Multi‑target source sharing: One canonical `shared/util/` simultaneously visible at `pkg/a/internal/util`, `pkg/b/util`, and `tools/build/util` while remaining a single editable origin.
- Folder‑level version config: A `.vise.cfg` (name TBD) inside `projectA/` declares `tool.node = 18.x`, while `projectB/` declares `tool.node = 20.x`; Vise injects the correct Node toolchain view into each tree without path juggling.
- Toolchain lattice: Install N variants of LLVM/Clang once; per‑folder configs select and inject the right compiler binaries + headers into `./toolchain/` transparently.
- Build ephemeral outputs: During a build, expose transient optimized artifacts at `build/bin/` backed by a cache; atomically replaced when recomputed.
- Overlay patching: Mount a patch layer that virtually applies diffs over a base tree (no checkout duplication) for quick experiments or CI try builds.
- Generated bindings: `src/gen/{python,ts,rust}/` all derive from one schema; editing a generated file can optionally redirect you upstream.
- Branch / time views: `repo/branches/main/...` and `repo/branches/feature-x/...` materialize different commit trees without full clones.
- Template expansion: A project skeleton appears already “instantiated” with variables resolved, yet the template + values remain the true source.
- Binary decomposition (optional, later): Expose sections of an executable (`/bin/app/__sections/`) for inspection while edits route through a reconstruction pipeline.
- Shared vendor shards: A deduplicated dependency store injected into multiple logical `vendor/` locations across sandboxes.

## 🧭 Vision (Draft)
Make filesystem composition—for code, tools, versions, generated artifacts, and experimental overlays—effortless and lossless. Shrink the distance between “I need these 5 views of the same underlying things” and having them mounted coherently, writable, and fast.

Core themes (evolving):
1. Multi‑presence truth: One origin, many mounted appearances; edits always unify.
2. Zero‑copy projection: Present structure without cloning or symlink gymnastics.
3. Config‑driven version & tool injection: Folder‑local config governs which toolchain (and variant) materializes there.
4. Ephemeral generation: On‑demand synthetic nodes (build outputs, templates, patches) with optional caching / pinning.
5. Deterministic layering: Ordered stack (base → patch → gen → injection) resolved predictably & explainably.
6. High‑leverage config + minimal API: Express injections & versions declaratively.
7. Observability & introspection: Inspect why a node exists and what layer + config produced it.

What Vise is NOT (early): a media processing suite, a universal remote data federator, or a kitchen‑sink transformer. Focus stays on source/layout composition, build & tooling acceleration, and version/layout virtualization.

Early differentiators:
- True multi‑injection (edit anywhere, single origin) beyond symlinks / bind mounts.
- Declarative folder‑scoped version/tool selection (config injection) instead of PATH churn.
- Layered virtual patch & generation model.
- Introspection hooks (`/__meta`, provenance traces) (planned).
- Build & version tooling primitives first, everything else second.

Initial feature target slices (subject to shuffle):
- Source multi‑injection engine
- Folder config parser + live reload
- Toolchain / version injection surface (Node, Zig self‑hosting variants, LLVM examples)
- Layered overlay / patch view
- Generated artifact projection (schema → code)
- Provenance & meta inspection endpoints

## 🗺️ Planned High‑Level Roadmap
- Milestone 0: Definition & design docs
- Milestone 1: Minimal prototype (local usage)
- Milestone 2: Core feature set + docs
- Milestone 3: Public beta / feedback cycle
- Milestone 4: Stable 1.0 release

## ✨ Intended Feature Buckets (Placeholders)
- Core engine / service
- API / SDK
- CLI tooling
- UI / dashboard (optional)
- Integrations / plugins
- Observability & metrics

## 🧪 Current Status
Nothing shipped yet. Active setup & scaffolding phase.

## 🚧 Next Up
- Draft architecture overview
- Define folder config spec (`.vise.cfg` placeholder)
- Prototype multi‑injection resolver
- Prototype toolchain injector (select Node / LLVM versions per folder config)
- Initialize codebase structure (Zig modules + UniFuse bindings)
- Add contribution guidelines & license

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Core language: Zig
- Low‑level FS: FUSE family via UniFuse abstraction (Linux FUSE, WinFSP, macFUSE)
- Config format: TBD (likely minimal declarative text: e.g. TOML / custom concise syntax)
- Caching layer: TBD (focus initially on in‑memory + simple on‑disk content store)
- Testing approach: Self‑hosted mounts + golden path integration tests
